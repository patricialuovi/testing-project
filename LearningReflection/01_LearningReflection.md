> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

Testing the GitLab web application was insightful. It helped me understand how manual testing works in real-world environments.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

I followed the assignment template structure and used predefined sections like Settings, Variables, and Test Cases. I structured both positive and negative test cases clearly.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 

No I don't think so.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

Visual Studio Code
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

Initially I had trouble understanding how to structure test cases, but after reading the examples and assignment guide, it became clearer.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

I have used GitHub before, but I had to refresh my memory on how to create a repository and upload folders.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

I would use Robot Framework because it is beginner-friendly and fits well for keyword-driven testing. Alternatively, Selenium with Python is also a good option.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

Based on LinkedIn, in-demand skills include Selenium, Cypress, Python, JavaScript, SQL, test automation frameworks, agile methodology, and bug tracking tools like Jira.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

Technical: Selenium, Robot Framework, SQL
Soft: Communication, attention to detail, documentation

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

This project helped me connect theory with practice. Writing structured test cases and finding bugs felt very practical. The assignment was clear, and I liked how it covered real application testing. It improved both my technical and analytical skills.
